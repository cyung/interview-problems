You have 2D grid where it is possible to move in any of the 8 directions. Given a sequence of points in the order you want to traverse them, calculate the minimum number of steps needed to reach all points. You start from the first point.

Example:
  input: [(0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,3), (6,0)]
  output: 9

Requirements:
Calculate distance between two points in O(1) time
