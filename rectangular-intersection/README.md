Given two rectangles, determine the intersection. Assume that all the
sides are either parallel to the x-axis or the y-axis.

Each rectangle is an object containing the following properties:
  x: x-coordinate of bottom-left corner
  y: y-coordinate of bottom-left corner
  width: width of rectangle
  height: height of rectangle

Your output should also be a rectangle object.
